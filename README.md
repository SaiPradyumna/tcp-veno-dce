<b>About DCE</b> 
<br>
Direct Code Execution (DCE) is a framework over ns-3 that provides a feature to run simulations using real Linux network stack. Besides, it provides a feature to use real network applications (such as iperf) inside ns-3 environment without changing their code. This feature helps to leverage the functionalities of existing network tools available for Linux inside the ns-3 environment. The main goal of the assignments listed below is to use DCE and validate the implementation of different TCPs in ns-3. All the projects listed are of direct interest to the ns-3 community.<br>

<b>​Validate the ns-3 implementation of TCP Veno </b><br>
<br>
Brief: TCP Veno is also targeted to improve the performance of TCP in wireless environments. It is a combination Vegas and Reno, and hence, named as Veno. <br>
In this project, the aim is to validate ns-3 TCP Veno implementation by comparing the results obtained from it to those obtained by simulating Linux TCP Veno.<br>
<br>
Required experience: C and C++ Bonus experience: Knowledge of TCP Veno and TCP <br>
